# Contributing Guide

Contributing to this repo is fairly easy. This document shows you how to
get the project, run all provided tests and generate a production ready build.

It also covers provided grunt tasks, that help you developing on this repo.

## Dependencies

To make sure, that the following instructions work, please install the following dependecies
on you machine:

- Node.js
- npm
- Git

If you install node through the binary installation file, **npm** will be already there.
When **npm** is installed, use it to install the needed npm packages:

- bower <code>npm install -g bower</code>
- grunt-cli <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code>
- karma <code>npm install -g karma</code>

````

This will clone the complete source to your local machine. Navigate to the project folder
and install all needed dendencies via **npm** and **bower**:

````
$ npm install --no-optional
$ bower install

The project is now installed and ready to be built.

## Building

This repo comes with a few **grunt tasks** which help you to automate
the development process. The following grunt tasks are provided:

#### <code>grunt</code>

Running <code>grunt</code> without any parameters, will actually execute the registered
default task. This task is currently nothing more then a **lint task**, to make sure
that your JavaScript code is written well.

#### <code>grunt test</code>

<code>grunt test</code> executes (as you might thought) the unit tests, which are located
in <code>test/unit</code>. The task uses **karma** the spectacular test runner to executes
the tests with the **jasmine testing framework**.

#### <code>grunt build</code>

You only have to use this task, if you want to generate a production ready build of
this project. This task will also **lint**, **test** and **minify** the
source. After running this task, you'll find the following files in a generated
<code>dist</code> folder:

````
dist/angular-workers-x.x.x.js
dist/angular-workers-x.x.x.min.js
````

#### <code>grunt watch</code>

This task will watch all relevant files. When it notice a change, it'll run the
**lint** and **test** task. Use this task while developing on the source
to make sure, everytime you make a change you get notified if your code is incosistent
or doesn't pass the tests.
